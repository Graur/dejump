Abstract:
Why we do this research
Research question

1. Introduction:
General description of the problem
Why we need to solve it
What we get as a result of our research

2. Methods:
General description of the algorithm in "two words"
Description of the tasks we should consider (That we need to separately consider the replacement of Forward Jump and Backward Jump.)

  2.1 forward jump
  Review of the object Goto forward.
  How it looks at EO/phi-calculus
  Proposed solution for this case
  and a theorem1 that we CAN do THIS like:
    2.1.1 return
    Solution for this section
    
    2.1.2 break
    Solution for this section
  
  Proof of the proposed theorem1 described above, using phi-calculus, which should show that our solution works
  (todo - make a proof on phi-calc)
    
  2.2 backward jump
  Review of the object Goto backward.
  How it looks at EO/phi-calculus
  Proposed solution for this case
  and a theorem2 that we CAN do THIS like:
    2.2.1 continue
    Solution for this section
    
  Proof of the proposed theorem2 described above, using phi-calculus, which should show that our solution works
  (todo - make a proof on phi-calc)
  
  2.3 Complex cases
  Analysis of complex cases of algorithm application and showing, how our solution will work at this cases
  
  2.4 Final algorithm
  Summarization both approaches and showing pseudo-code of the algorithm itself
  
  
3. Results and Discussion
Summing up of a research and smth more??
